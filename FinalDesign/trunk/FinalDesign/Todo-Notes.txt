Things we can still improve on:

 - Skin detection (lighting independence, AND/OR ability to adjust/calibrate to lighting condition)
 - Color band detection (lighting independence)
 - Multiple IR Arrays for IR lighting
 - Better box for Wiimote and Camera
 - Better placement of Wiimote and Camera
 - 

Things we need to ask for:
 - White lights that can be placed next to our booth.
   We are one of the first booths there (as you enter DC). That location does not have very good lighting, 
   if I remember right (no artificial lights overhead, natural light not very much).
